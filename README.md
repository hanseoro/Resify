About<br> 
Resify helps prevent rental scams by generating property certificates of verified homeowners using the Melissa API. 
Resify employs a two-layered verification procedure for homeowners to become a verified owner of a property. The first 
layer involves checking the homeowner's identity using the SSN-Name Verify Web API and comparing their property address using
the Melissa Property Web API. The second layer of verification involves using Melissa's Global IP Web API and Reverse 
GeoCoder Web API where homeowners need to be physically inside the property they want to verify.

Motive<br> 
Many UCI students searching for housing often often fall victim to rental scams. With this project, our group aims to develop 
a tool that allows students to prevent housing scams by first asking for proof of ownership from homeowners.
